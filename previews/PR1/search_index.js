However, the accuracy of the result is more likely to be limited by the algorithm itself than the way the date has been expressed.\nn.b. TT can be used instead of TDB in most applications.\nOn return, the arrays pvh and pvb contain the following:\npvh[0][0]  x       }    pvh[0][1]  y       } heliocentric position, au    pvh[0][2]  z       }\npvh[1][0]  xdot    }    pvh[1][1]  ydot    } heliocentric velocity, au/d    pvh[1][2]  zdot    }\npvb[0][0]  x       }    pvb[0][1]  y       } barycentric position, au    pvb[0][2]  z       }\npvb[1][0]  xdot    }    pvb[1][1]  ydot    } barycentric velocity, au/d    pvb[1][2]  zdot    }\nThe vectors are with respect to the Barycentric Celestial Reference System.  The time unit is one day in TDB.\nThe function is a SIMPLIFIED SOLUTION from the planetary theory VSOP2000 (X. Moisson, P. Bretagnon, 2001, Celes. Mechanics & Dyn. Astron., 80, 3/4, 205-213) and is an adaptation of original Fortran code supplied by P. Bretagnon (private comm., 2000).\nComparisons over the time span 1900-2100 with this simplified solution and the JPL DE405 ephemeris give the following results:\n                       RMS    max\n  Heliocentric:\n     position error    3.7   11.2   km\n     velocity error    1.4    5.0   mm/s\n\n  Barycentric:\n     position error    4.6   13.4   km\n     velocity error    1.4    4.9   mm/s\nComparisons with the JPL DE406 ephemeris show that by 1800 and 2200 the position errors are approximately double their 1900-2100 size. By 1500 and 2500 the deterioration is a factor of 10 and by 1000 and 3000 a factor of 60.  The velocity accuracy falls off at about half that rate.\nIt is permissible to use the same array for pvh and pvb, which will receive the barycentric values.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"SOFA/ephemerides/#AstroCouch.SOFA.moon98","page":"Ephemerides","title":"AstroCouch.SOFA.moon98","text":"moon98(day1::Float64, day2::Float64)\n\nApproximate geocentric position and velocity of the Moon.\n\nn.b.

The MJD method and the date & time methods are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.  The limited accuracy of the present algorithm is such that any of the methods is satisfactory.\nThis function is a full implementation of the algorithm published by Meeus (see reference) except that the light-time correction to the Moon's mean longitude has been omitted.\nComparisons with ELP/MPP02 over the interval 1950-2100 gave RMS errors of 2.9 arcsec in geocentric direction, 6.1 km in position and 36 mm/s in velocity.  The worst case errors were 18.3 arcsec in geocentric direction, 31.7 km in position and 172 mm/s in velocity.\nThe original algorithm is expressed in terms of \"dynamical time\", which can either be TDB or TT without any significant change in accuracy.  UT cannot be used without incurring significant errors (30 arcsec in the present era) due to the Moon's 0.5 arcsec/sec movement.\nThe result is with respect to the GCRS (the same as J2000.0 mean equator and equinox to within 23 mas).\nVelocity is obtained by a complete analytical differentiation of the Meeus model.\nThe Meeus algorithm generates position and velocity in mean ecliptic coordinates of date, which the present function then rotates into GCRS.  Because the ecliptic system is precessing, there is a coupling between this spin (about 1.4 degrees per century) and the Moon position that produces a small velocity contribution.  In the present function this effect is neglected as it corresponds to a maximum difference of less than 3 mm/s and increases the RMS error by only 0.4%.\n\nReferences\n\nMeeus, J., Astronomical Algorithms, 2nd edition, Willmann-Bell, 1998, p337.\n\nSimon, J.L., Bretagnon, P., Chapront, J., Chapront-Touze, M., Francou, G. & Laskar, J., Astron.Astrophys., 1994, 282, 663\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"SOFA/ephemerides/#AstroCouch.SOFA.plan94","page":"Ephemerides","title":"AstroCouch.SOFA.plan94","text":"plan94(day1::Float64, day2::Float64, planet::Int)\n\nApproximate heliocentric position and velocity of a nominated major planet: Mercury, Venus, EMB, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus or Neptune (but not the Earth itself).\n\nn.b.

Fortran code differs from the original in the following respects:\nC instead of Fortran.\nThe date is supplied in two parts.\nThe result is returned only in equatorial Cartesian form;  the ecliptic longitude, latitude and radius vector are not  returned.\nThe result is in the J2000.0 equatorial frame, not ecliptic.\nMore is done in-line: there are fewer calls to subroutines.\nDifferent error/warning status values are used.\nA different Kepler's-equation-solver is used (avoiding  use of double precision complex).\nPolynomials in t are nested to minimize rounding errors.\nExplicit double constants are used to avoid mixed-mode  expressions.\nNone of the above changes affects the result significantly.\nThe returned status indicates the most serious condition encountered during execution of the function.  Illegal np is considered the most serious, overriding failure to converge, which in turn takes precedence over the remote date warning.\n\nReferences\n\nSimon, J.L, Bretagnon, P., Chapront, J., Chapront-Touze, M., Francou, G., and Laskar, J., Astron.Astrophys., 282, 663 (1994).\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"SOFA/gnomonic/#gnomonic.jl","page":"Gnomonic","title":"gnomonic.jl","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"SOFA/gnomonic/#AstroCouch.SOFA.tpors","page":"Gnomonic","title":"AstroCouch.SOFA.tpors","text":"tpors(ξ::Float64, η::Float64, a::Float64, b::Float64)\n\nIn the tangent plane projection, given the rectangular coordinates of a star and its spherical coordinates, determine the spherical coordinates of the tangent point.\n\nInput\n\nξ, η  – rectangular coordinates of star image (Note 2)\na, b  – star's spherical coordinates (Note 3)\n\nOutput\n\na01, b01 – tangent point's spherical coordinates, Soln. 1\na02, b02 – tangent point's spherical coordinates, Soln. 2\n\nNote\n\nThe tangent plane projection is also called the \"gnomonic projection\" and the \"central projection\".\nThe eta axis points due north in the adopted coordinate system.

In the 1960-1972 era there were smaller jumps (in either direction) each time the linear UTC(TAI) expression was changed, and these \"mini-leaps\" are also included in the ERFA convention.\nThe warning status \"dubious year\" flags UTCs that predate the introduction of the time scale or that are too far in the future to be trusted.

If this is attempted, zero is returned together with a warning status.\nBecause leap seconds cannot, in principle, be predicted in advance, a reliable check for dates beyond the valid range is impossible. To guard against gross errors, a year five or more after the release year of the present function (see the constant IYV) is considered dubious.  In this case a warning status is returned but the result is computed in the normal way.\nFor both too-early and too-late years, the warning status is +1. This is distinct from the error status -1, which signifies a year so early that JD could not be computed.\nIf the specified date is for a day which ends with a leap second, the TAI-UTC value returned is for the period leading up to the leap second.  If the date is for a day which begins as a leap second ends, the TAI-UTC returned is for the period following the leap second.\nThe day number must be in the normal calendar range, for example 1 through 30 for April.  The \"almanac\" convention of allowing such dates as January 0 and December 32 is not supported in this function, in order to avoid confusion near leap seconds.\nThe fraction of day is used only for dates before the introduction of leap seconds, the first of which occurred at the end of 1971. It is tested for validity (0 to 1 is the valid range) even if not used; if invalid, zero is used and status -4 is returned.

The J2000 method is best matched to the way the argument is handled internally and will deliver the optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.\nAlthough the date is, formally, barycentric dynamical time (TDB), the terrestrial dynamical time (TT) can be used with no practical effect on the accuracy of the prediction.\nTT can be regarded as a coordinate time that is realized as an offset of 32.184s from International Atomic Time, TAI.  TT is a specific linear transformation of geocentric coordinate time TCG, which is the time scale for the Geocentric Celestial Reference System, GCRS.\nTDB is a coordinate time, and is a specific linear transformation of barycentric coordinate time TCB, which is the time scale for the Barycentric Celestial Reference System, BCRS.\nThe difference TCG-TCB depends on the masses and positions of the bodies of the solar system and the velocity of the Earth.  It is dominated by a rate difference, the residual being of a periodic character.  The latter, which is modeled by the present function, comprises a main (annual) sinusoidal term of amplitude approximately 0.00166 seconds, plus planetary terms up to about 20 microseconds, and lunar and diurnal terms up to 2 microseconds. These effects come from the changing transverse Doppler effect and gravitational red-shift as the observer (on the Earth's surface) experiences variations in speed (with respect to the BCRS) and gravitational potential.\nTDB can be regarded as the same as TCB but with a rate adjustment to keep it close to TT, which is convenient for many applications. The history of successive attempts to define TDB is set out in Resolution 3 adopted by the IAU General Assembly in 2006, which defines a fixed TDB(TCB) transformation that is consistent with contemporary solar-system ephemerides.  Future ephemerides will imply slightly changed transformations between TCG and TCB, which could introduce a linear drift between TDB and TT; however, any such drift is unlikely to exceed 1 nanosecond per century.\nThe geocentric TDB-TT model used in the present function is that of Fairhead & Bretagnon (1990), in its full form.  It was originally supplied by Fairhead (private communications with P.T.Wallace,\nas a Fortran subroutine.  The present C function contains an\nadaptation of the Fairhead code.  The numerical results are essentially unaffected by the changes, the differences with respect to the Fairhead & Bretagnon original being at the 1e-20 s level.\nThe topocentric part of the model is from Moyer (1981) and Murray (1983), with fundamental arguments adapted from Simon et al. 1994. It is an approximation to the expression ( v / c ) . ( r / c ), where v is the barycentric velocity of the Earth, r is the geocentric position of the observer and c is the speed of light.\nBy supplying zeroes for u and v, the topocentric part of the model can be nullified, and the function will return the Fairhead & Bretagnon result alone.\nDuring the interval 1950-2050, the absolute accuracy is better than +/- 3 nanoseconds relative to time ephemerides obtained by direct numerical integrations based on the JPL DE405 solar system ephemeris.\nIt must be stressed that the present function is merely a model, and that numerical integration of solar-system ephemerides is the definitive method for predicting the relationship between TCG and TCB and hence between TT and TDB.\n\nReferences\n\nFairhead, L., & Bretagnon, P., Astron.Astrophys., 229, 240-247 (1990).\n\nIAU 2006 Resolution 3.\n\nMcCarthy, D.

The convention in the present function is that the JD day represents UTC days whether the length is 86399, 86400 or 86401 SI seconds.\nApplications should use the function eraDtf2d to convert from calendar date and time of day into 2-part quasi Julian Date, as it implements the leap-second-ambiguity convention just described.\nThe warning status \"dubious year\" flags UTCs that predate the introduction of the time scale or that are too far in the future to be trusted.  See eraDat for further details.\nUT1-UTC is tabulated in IERS bulletins.  It increases by exactly one second at the end of each positive UTC leap second, introduced in order to keep UT1-UTC within +/- 0.9s.  n.b. This practice is under review, and in the future UT1-UTC may grow essentially without limit.\nThe geographical coordinates are with respect to the ERFA_WGS84 reference ellipsoid.  TAKE CARE WITH THE LONGITUDE SIGN: the longitude required by the present function is east-positive (i.e. right-handed), in accordance with geographical convention.\nThe polar motion xp,yp can be obtained from IERS bulletins.  The\nvalues are the coordinates (in radians) of the Celestial Intermediate Pole with respect to the International Terrestrial Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), measured along the meridians 0 and 90 deg west respectively.  For many applications, xp and yp can be set to zero.\nIf hm, the height above the ellipsoid of the observing station in meters, is not known but phpa, the pressure in hPa (=mB), is available, an adequate estimate of hm can be obtained from the expression\n   hm = -29.3 * tsl * log ( phpa / 1013.25 );\nwhere tsl is the approximate sea-level air temperature in K (See Astrophysical Quantities, C.W.Allen, 3rd edition, section 52). Similarly, if the pressure phpa is not known, it can be estimated from the height of the observing station, hm, as follows:\n   phpa = 1013.25 * exp ( -hm / ( 29.3 * tsl ) );\nNote, however, that the refraction is nearly proportional to the pressure and that an accurate phpa value is important for precise work.\nThe argument wl specifies the observing wavelength in micrometers. The transition from optical to radio is assumed to occur at 100 micrometers (about 3000 GHz).\nThe accuracy of the result is limited by the corrections for  refraction, which use a simple Atan(z) + Btan^3(z) model.  Providing the meteorological parameters are known accurately and  there are no gross local effects, the predicted observed  coordinates should be within 0.05 arcsec (optical) or 1 arcsec  (radio) for a zenith distance of less than 70 degrees, better than  30 arcsec (optical or radio) at 85 degrees and better than 20  arcmin (optical) or 30 arcmin (radio) at the horizon.\nWithout refraction, the complementary functions eraAtco13 and  eraAtoc13 are self-consistent to better than 1 microarcsecond all  over the celestial sphere.  With refraction included, consistency  falls off at high zenith distances, but is still better than 0.05  arcsec at 85 degrees.\n\"Observed\" Az,ZD means the position that would be seen by a  perfect geodetically aligned theodolite.  (Zenith distance is used  rather than altitude in order to reflect the fact that no  allowance is made for depression of the horizon.)  This is related  to the observed HA,Dec via the standard rotation, using the  geodetic latitude (corrected for polar motion), while the observed  HA and RA are related simply through the Earth rotation angle and  the site longitude.  \"Observed\" RA,Dec or HA,Dec thus means the  position that would be seen by a perfect equatorial with its polar  axis aligned to the Earth's axis of rotation.\nIt is advisable to take great care with units, as even unlikely  values of the input parameters are accepted and processed in  accordance with the models used.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"SOFA/astrometry/#AstroCouch.SOFA.atic13","page":"Astrometry","title":"AstroCouch.SOFA.atic13","text":"atic13(ri::Float64, di::Float64, day1::Float64, day2::Float64)\n\nTransform star RA,Dec from geocentric CIRS to ICRS astrometric.\n\nInput\n\nri, di – CIRS geocentric RA,Dec (radians)\ndate1  – TDB as a 2-part...\ndate2  – ...Julian Date (Note 1)\n\nOutput\n\nrc, dc – ICRS astrometric RA,Dec (radians)\neo     – equation of the origins (ERA-GST, Note 4)\n\nNote\n\nThe TDB date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any convenient way between the two arguments.

The J2000 method is best matched to the way the argument is handled internally and will deliver the optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.\nIn accordance with normal star-catalog conventions, the object's right ascension and declination are freed from the effects of secular aberration.  The frame, which is aligned to the catalog equator and equinox, is Lorentzian and centered on the SSB.\nThe proper motions are the rate of change of the right ascension and declination at the catalog epoch and are in radians per TDB Julian year.\nThe parallax and radial velocity are in the same frame.\nCare is needed with units.  The star coordinates are in radians and the proper motions in radians per Julian year, but the parallax is in arcseconds.\nThe RA proper motion is in terms of coordinate angle, not true angle.  If the catalog uses arcseconds for both RA and Dec proper motions, the RA proper motion will need to be divided by cos(Dec) before use.\nStraight-line motion at constant speed, in the inertial frame, is assumed.\nAn extremely small (or zero or negative) parallax is overridden to ensure that the object is at a finite but very large distance, but not so large that the proper motion is equivalent to a large but safe speed (about 0.1c using the chosen constant).  A warning status of 1 is added to the status if this action has been taken.\nIf the space velocity is a significant fraction of c (see the constant VMAX in the function eraStarpv), it is arbitrarily set to zero.  When this action occurs, 2 is added to the status.\nThe relativistic adjustment carried out in the eraStarpv function involves an iterative calculation.

Zero pressure is permissible, and causes zeroes to be returned.\nThe algorithm draws on several sources, as follows:\na) The formula for the saturation vapour pressure of water as a    function of temperature and temperature is taken from Equations    (A4.5-A4.7) of Gill (1982).\nb) The formula for the water vapour pressure, given the saturation    pressure and the relative humidity, is from Crane (1976),    Equation (2.5.5).\nc) The refractivity of air is a function of temperature, total    pressure, water-vapour pressure and, in the case of optical/IR,    wavelength.  The formulae for the two cases are developed from    Hohenkerk & Sinclair (1985) and Rueger (2002).  The IAG (1999)    optical refractivity for dry air is used.\nd) The formula for beta, the ratio of the scale height of the    atmosphere to the geocentric distance of the observer, is an    adaption of Equation (9) from Stone (1996).  The adaptations,    arrived at empirically, consist of (i) a small adjustment to the    coefficient and (ii) a humidity term for the radio case only.\ne) The formulae for the refraction constants as a function of n-1    and beta are from Green (1987), Equation (4.31).\n\nReferences\n\nCrane, R.K., Meeks, M.L.

The MJD method and the date & time methods are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.\nThe nutation components in longitude and obliquity are in radians and with respect to the equinox and ecliptic of date.  The obliquity at J2000.0 is assumed to be the Lieske et al. (1977) value of 84381.448 arcsec.\nBoth the luni-solar and planetary nutations are included.  The latter are due to direct planetary nutations and the perturbations of the lunar and terrestrial orbits.\nThe function computes the MHB2000 nutation series with the associated corrections for planetary nutations.  It is an implementation of the nutation part of the IAU 2000A precession- nutation model, formally adopted by the IAU General Assembly in 2000, namely MHB2000 (Mathews et al. 2002), but with the free core nutation (FCN - see Note 4) omitted.\nThe full MHB2000 model also contains contributions to the nutations in longitude and obliquity due to the free-excitation of the free-core-nutation during the period 1979-2000.  These FCN terms, which are time-dependent and unpredictable, are NOT included in the present function and, if required, must be independently computed. With the FCN corrections included, the present function delivers a pole which is at current epochs accurate to a few hundred microarcseconds.  The omission of FCN introduces further errors of about that size.\nThe present function provides classical nutation.  The MHB2000 algorithm, from which it is adapted, deals also with (i) the offsets between the GCRS and mean poles and (ii) the adjustments in longitude and obliquity due to the changed precession rates.  These additional functions, namely frame bias and precession adjustments, are supported by the ERFA functions eraBi00 and eraPr00.\nThe MHB2000 algorithm also provides \"total\" nutations, comprising the arithmetic sum of the frame bias, precession adjustments, luni-solar nutation and planetary nutation.  These total nutations can be used in combination with an existing IAU 1976 precession implementation, such as eraPmat76, to deliver GCRS- to-true predictions of sub-mas accuracy at current dates.  However, there are three shortcomings in the MHB2000 model that must be taken into account if more accurate or definitive results are required (see Wallace 2002):\n(i) The MHB2000 total nutations are simply arithmetic sums,       yet in reality the various components are successive Euler       rotations.  This slight lack of rigor leads to cross terms       that exceed 1 mas after a century.  The rigorous procedure       is to form the GCRS-to-true rotation matrix by applying the       bias, precession and nutation in that order.\n(ii) Although the precession adjustments are stated to be with       respect to Lieske et al. (1977), the MHB2000 model does       not specify which set of Euler angles are to be used and       how the adjustments are to be applied.  The most literal       and straightforward procedure is to adopt the 4-rotation       epsilon0, psiA, omegaA, xiA option, and to add DPSIPR       to psiA and DEPSPR to both omegaA and eps_A.\n(iii) The MHB2000 model predates the determination by Chapront       et al. (2002) of a 14.6 mas displacement between the       J2000.0 mean equinox and the origin of the ICRS frame.  It       should, however, be noted that neglecting this displacement       when calculating star coordinates does not lead to a       14.6 mas change in right ascension, only a small second-       order distortion in the pattern of the precession-nutation       effect.\nFor these reasons, the ERFA functions do not generate the \"total nutations\" directly, though they can of course easily be generated by calling eraBi00, eraPr00 and the present function and adding the results.\nThe MHB2000 model contains 41 instances where the same frequency appears multiple times, of which 38 are duplicates and three are triplicates.  To keep the present code close to the original MHB algorithm, this small inefficiency has not been corrected.\n\nReferences\n\nChapront, J., Chapront-Touze, M. & Francou, G. 2002, Astron.Astrophys. 387, 700\n\nLieske, J.H., Lederle, T., Fricke, W. & Morando, B. 1977, Astron.Astrophys. 58, 1-16\n\nMathews, P.M., Herring, T.A., Buffet, B.A. 2002, J.Geophys.Res.  107, B4.

(The errors that result from using this function with the IAU 2006 value of 84381.406 arcsec can be neglected.)\nThe nutation model consists only of luni-solar terms, but includes also a fixed offset which compensates for certain long- period planetary terms (Note 7).\nThis function is an implementation of the IAU 2000B abridged nutation model formally adopted by the IAU General Assembly in\nThe function computes the MHB2000SHORT luni-solar nutation\nseries (Luzum 2001), but without the associated corrections for the precession rate adjustments and the offset between the GCRS and J2000.0 mean poles.\nThe full IAU 2000A (MHB2000) nutation model contains nearly 1400 terms.  The IAU 2000B model (McCarthy & Luzum 2003) contains only 77 terms, plus additional simplifications, yet still delivers results of 1 mas accuracy at present epochs.  This combination of accuracy and size makes the IAU 2000B abridged nutation model suitable for most practical applications.\nThe function delivers a pole accurate to 1 mas from 1900 to 2100 (usually better than 1 mas, very occasionally just outside 1 mas). The full IAU 2000A model, which is implemented in the function eraNut00a (q.v.), delivers considerably greater accuracy at current dates; however, to realize this improved accuracy, corrections for the essentially unpredictable free-core-nutation (FCN) must also be included.\nThe present function provides classical nutation.  The MHB2000SHORT algorithm, from which it is adapted, deals also with (i) the offsets between the GCRS and mean poles and (ii) the adjustments in longitude and obliquity due to the changed precession rates.  These additional functions, namely frame bias and precession adjustments, are supported by the ERFA functions eraBi00 and eraPr00.\nThe MHB2000SHORT algorithm also provides \"total\" nutations, comprising the arithmetic sum of the frame bias, precession adjustments, and nutation (luni-solar + planetary).  These total nutations can be used in combination with an existing IAU 1976 precession implementation, such as eraPmat76, to deliver GCRS- to-true predictions of mas accuracy at current epochs.  However, for symmetry with the eraNut00a function (q.v. for the reasons), the ERFA functions do not generate the \"total nutations\" directly. Should they be required, they could of course easily be generated by calling eraBi00, eraPr00 and the present function and adding the results.\nThe IAU 2000B model includes \"planetary bias\" terms that are fixed in size but compensate for long-period nutations.  The amplitudes quoted in McCarthy & Luzum (2003), namely Dpsi = -1.5835 mas and Depsilon = +1.6339 mas, are optimized for the \"total nutations\" method described in Note 6.  The Luzum (2001) values used in this ERFA implementation, namely -0.135 mas and +0.388 mas, are optimized for the \"rigorous\" method, where frame bias, precession and nutation are applied separately and in that order.  During the interval 1995-2050, the ERFA implementation delivers a maximum error of 1.001 mas (not including FCN).\n\nReferences\n\nLieske, J.H., Lederle, T., Fricke, W., Morando, B., \"Expressions for the precession quantities based upon the IAU /1976/ system of astronomical constants\", Astron.Astrophys. 58, 1-2, 1-16.

(2006) Table 1 also contains angles that depend on models distinct from the P03 precession theory itself, namely the IAU 2000A frame bias and nutation.  The quoted polynomials are used in other ERFA functions:\n. eraXy06  contains the polynomial parts of the X and Y series.\n. eraS06  contains the polynomial part of the s+XY/2 series.\n. eraPfw06  implements the series for the Fukushima-Williams   angles that are with respect to the GCRS pole (i.e. the variants   that include frame bias).\nThe IAU resolution stipulated that the choice of parameterization was left to the user, and so an IAU compliant precession implementation can be constructed using various combinations of the angles returned by the present function.\nThe parameterization used by ERFA is the version of the Fukushima- Williams angles that refers directly to the GCRS pole.  These angles may be calculated by calling the function eraPfw06.  ERFA also supports the direct computation of the CIP GCRS X,Y by series, available by calling eraXy06.\nThe agreement between the different parameterizations is at the 1 microarcsecond level in the present era.\nWhen constructing a precession formulation that refers to the GCRS pole rather than the dynamical pole, it may (depending on the choice of angles) be necessary to introduce the frame bias explicitly.\nIt is permissible to re-use the same variable in the returned arguments.

The MJD method and the date & time methods are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.\nThe precession adjustments are expressed as \"nutation components\", corrections in longitude and obliquity with respect to the J2000.0 equinox and ecliptic.\nAlthough the precession adjustments are stated to be with respect to Lieske et al. (1977), the MHB2000 model does not specify which set of Euler angles are to be used and how the adjustments are to be applied.  The most literal and straightforward procedure is to adopt the 4-rotation epsilon0, psiA, omegaA, xiA option, and to add dpsipr to psiA and depspr to both omegaA and eps_A.\nThis is an implementation of one aspect of the IAU 2000A nutation model, formally adopted by the IAU General Assembly in 2000, namely MHB2000 (Mathews et al. 2002).\n\nReferences\n\nLieske, J.H., Lederle, T., Fricke, W. & Morando, B., \"Expressions for the precession quantities based upon the IAU (1976) System of Astronomical Constants\", Astron.Astrophys., 58, 1-16 (1977)\n\nMathews, P.M., Herring, T.A., Buffet, B.A., \"Modeling of nutation and precession New nutation series for nonrigid Earth and insights into the Earth's interior\", J.Geophys.Res., 107, B4, 2002.

The two dates may be expressed using different methods, but at the risk of losing some resolution.\nThe accumulated precession angles zeta, z, theta are expressed through canonical polynomials which are valid only for a limited time span.  In addition, the IAU 1976 precession rate is known to be imperfect.  The absolute accuracy of the present formulation is better than 0.1 arcsec from 1960AD to 2040AD, better than 1 arcsec from 1640AD to 2360AD, and remains below 3 arcsec for the whole of the period 500BC to 3000AD.  The errors exceed 10 arcsec outside the range 1200BC to 3900AD, exceed 100 arcsec outside 4200BC to 5600AD and exceed 1000 arcsec outside 6800BC to 8200AD.\nThe three angles are returned in the conventional order, which is not the same as the order of the corresponding Euler rotations.

Change of standard epoch from B1950.0 to J2000.0.\n. An intermediate transition date of 1984 January 1.0 TT.\n. A change of precession model.\n. Change of time unit for proper motion (tropical to Julian).\n. FK4 positions include the E-terms of aberration, to simplify   the hand computation of annual aberration.  FK5 positions   assume a rigorous aberration computation based on the Earth's   barycentric velocity.\n. The E-terms also affect proper motions, and in particular cause   objects at large distances to exhibit fictitious proper   motions.\nThe algorithm is based on Smith et al. (1989) and Yallop et al. (1989), which presented a matrix method due to Standish (1982) as developed by Aoki et al. (1983), using Kinoshita's development of Andoyer's post-Newcomb precession.  The numerical constants from Seidelmann (1992) are used canonically.\nConversion from B1950.0 FK4 to J2000.0 FK5 only is provided for. Conversions for different epochs and equinoxes would require additional treatment for precession, proper motion and E-terms.\nIn the FK4 catalog the proper motions of stars within 10 degrees of the poles do not embody differential E-terms effects and should, strictly speaking, be handled in a different manner from stars outside these regions.  However, given the general lack of homogeneity of the star data available for routine astrometry, the difficulties of handling positions that may have been determined from astrometric fields spanning the polar and non- polar regions, the likelihood that the differential E-terms effect was not taken into account when allowing for proper motion in past astrometry, and the undesirability of a discontinuity in the algorithm, the decision has been made in this ERFA algorithm to include the effects of differential E-terms on the proper motions for all stars, whether polar or not.  At epoch J2000.0, and measuring \"on the sky\" rather than in terms of RA change, the errors resulting from this simplification are less than 1 milliarcsecond in position and 1 milliarcsecond per century in proper motion.\n\nReferences\n\nAoki, S. et al., 1983, \"Conversion matrix of epoch B1950.0 FK4-based positions of stars to epoch J2000.0 positions in accordance with the new IAU resolutions\".

The J2000 method is best matched to the way the argument is handled internally and will deliver the optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.\nIn accordance with normal star-catalog conventions, the object's right ascension and declination are freed from the effects of secular aberration.  The frame, which is aligned to the catalog equator and equinox, is Lorentzian and centered on the SSB.\nThe proper motions are the rate of change of the right ascension and declination at the catalog epoch and are in radians per TDB Julian year.\nThe parallax and radial velocity are in the same frame.\nCare is needed with units.  The star coordinates are in radians and the proper motions in radians per Julian year, but the parallax is in arcseconds.\nThe RA proper motion is in terms of coordinate angle, not true angle.  If the catalog uses arcseconds for both RA and Dec proper motions, the RA proper motion will need to be divided by cos(Dec) before use.\nStraight-line motion at constant speed, in the inertial frame, is assumed.\nAn extremely small (or zero or negative) parallax is interpreted to mean that the object is on the \"celestial sphere\", the radius of which is an arbitrary (large) value (see the eraStarpv function for the value used).  When the distance is overridden in this way, the status, initially zero, has 1 added to it.\nIf the space velocity is a significant fraction of c (see the constant VMAX in the function eraStarpv), it is arbitrarily set to zero.  When this action occurs, 2 is added to the status.\nThe relativistic adjustment carried out in the eraStarpv function involves an iterative calculation.  If the process fails to converge within a set number of iterations, 4 is added to the status.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"SOFA/equatorial/#equatorial.jl","page":"Equatorial","title":"equatorial.jl","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"SOFA/equatorial/#AstroCouch.SOFA.ae2hd","page":"Equatorial","title":"AstroCouch.SOFA.ae2hd","text":"ae2hd(azimuth::Float64, altitude::Float64, latitude::Float64)\n\nHorizon to equatorial coordinates.

However, if the rotation of the Earth were constant in an inertial frame the classical formulation would lead to apparent irregularities in the UT1 timescale traceable to side- effects of precession-nutation.

If UT1 is used for both purposes, errors of order 100 microarcseconds result.\nAlthough the function uses the IAU 2006 series for s+XY/2, it is otherwise independent of the precession-nutation model and can in practice be used with any equinox-based NPB matrix.\nThe result is returned in the range 0 to 2pi.\n\nReferences\n\nWallace, P.T. & Capitaine, N., 2006, Astron.Astrophys. 459, 981\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"SOFA/rotations/#AstroCouch.SOFA.gst06a","page":"Rotations","title":"AstroCouch.SOFA.gst06a","text":"gst06a(ut1::Float64, ut2::Float64, tt1::Float64, tt2::Float64)\n\nGreenwich apparent sidereal time (consistent with IAU 2000 and 2006 resolutions).\n\nInput\n\nuta   – UT1 as Julian Date (Notes 1,2)\nutb   – ... as Julian Date\ntta   – TT as Julian Date (Notes 1,2)\nttb   – ... as Julian Date\n\nOutput\n\ngst   – Greenwich apparent sidereal time (radians)\n\nNote\n\nThe UT1 and TT dates uta+utb and tta+ttb respectively, are both Julian Dates, apportioned in any convenient way between the argument pairs.
